# M365 surface coverage for the `agent365` plugin

**Snapshot:** 2026-05-12 (slice 19u-a + post-walkthrough reframe).

This file maps every Microsoft 365 / Agent 365 / Copilot surface where
a Hermes agent could plausibly appear, with our adapter's coverage
status for each. Microsoft's surface inventory drifts fast — refresh
this on every walkthrough.

## Positioning: Hermes-A365 vs sibling Hermes Teams plugins

Hermes ships its own **classic-Bot-Framework Microsoft Teams adapter**
(see `plugins/platforms/teams/adapter.py` in the harness, shipped
v2026.4.30; in-flight enhancements in
[hermes-agent#10037](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/10037)
and [hermes-agent#13767](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/13767)).
**That is the right tool when you want Hermes as a generic Teams chat
bot** — Azure App Registration + client secret / certificate / Managed
Identity + Teams app manifest with `bots[]`; reach is DM, channels,
group chats, threading, file attachments.

**Hermes-A365 covers what classic Teams bots structurally cannot:**

| Path | Surfacing | Operator prerequisites | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — AI Teammate** (M365 agentic user) | Agent appears in M365 tenant directory + "Built for your org" picker + M365 People search + agentic-user audit trails. Teams 1:1 chat with M365-native identity (distinct from a classic bot's user-facing affordance). | M365 tenant + Frontier Preview Program + Tier 3 license. **No Azure subscription.** | ✅ Round-8 end-to-end 2026-05-11 (v0.2.0 wizard, v0.3.0 streaming); v0.5.0/v0.5.1 proactive soak 2026-05-13 |
| **B — Custom Engine Agent** (Azure Bot Service + 1.21 manifest) | Agent appears in M365 Copilot Chat's agents picker, side-panels in Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Outlook, and Copilot-fabric search. Also reaches classic Teams surfaces (1:1 / group / channel) as a side effect of the Microsoft Teams channel on Bot Service. | Path A's prerequisites **+ Azure subscription** for Bot Service registration of the blueprint Entra app with the Microsoft Teams channel enabled. | ⏸ Emitter shipped 2026-05-12 (slice 19u-a, `hermes a365 publish --copilot-chat`); live surfacing test deferred pending Azure subscription provisioning (#16). |

Both paths share the same blueprint Entra app + service principal + bot
endpoint (`/api/messages`), so an operator with both prerequisites can
run both surfaces from one Hermes-A365 install. They are not mutually
exclusive.

**When to pick what:**

- *"Hermes is a chat bot in Teams (DM / channels / group / file uploads)"* →
  sibling Hermes Teams adapter (classic BF). No M365 directory identity,
  no Copilot Chat surfacing.
- *"Hermes is a first-class agentic user in our M365 tenant directory"* →
  Hermes-A365 Path A (AI Teammate). Teams 1:1 with M365-native identity.
- *"Hermes surfaces in M365 Copilot Chat and the Copilot side-panels"* →
  Hermes-A365 Path B (Custom Engine Agent). Requires Azure subscription.
- *"All of the above"* → install both Hermes' Teams adapter AND
  Hermes-A365; configure each for its lane.

## Architectural framing

Microsoft has three orthogonal layers an "agent" can sit in. **Hermes-A365
operates in layers 1 and 3 (identity + surface); the sibling Teams
adapter operates in layer 3 only.**

| layer | what lives here | sibling Teams adapter | Hermes-A365 Path A | Hermes-A365 Path B |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Identity / governance ("Agent 365") | agent registry, agentic users, audit, Purview / Defender hooks | bot identity only (Entra app, no agentic user) | ✅ agentic user template + M365 directory entry | bot identity only; uses Bot Service registration |
| Authoring / runtime ("M365 Copilot extensibility") | **declarative agents** vs **custom-engine agents** | custom-engine via classic BF | custom-engine via M365 agentic user routing | custom-engine via Bot Service routing |
| Surface ("the channel the user is using") | Teams / Copilot Chat / Outlook / etc. | Teams 1:1, group, channel | Teams 1:1 ("Built for your org" picker) | Copilot Chat picker, side-panels, classic Teams reach as side effect |

All three reach the surface layer via the **Bot Framework activity
protocol** over a single `/api/messages` endpoint — every channel below
that says "BF activity" gets normalized into the same inbound shape.
What differs is **how Microsoft's routing layer decides to forward
activities to that endpoint** (agentic user instance vs Bot Service
channel vs classic BF channel) and what the agent's user-facing
identity looks like.

Declarative agents are a *different runtime entirely* — they don't
have a bot endpoint, they have a manifest Microsoft's orchestrator
parses. Surfaces that only work as declarative agents (some Word /
Excel / PowerPoint native experiences) are out of scope for both
Hermes-A365 and the sibling Teams adapter.

## Coverage matrix

Legend:

- ✅ **shipped + validated** — Hermes-A365 covers this end-to-end, validated live
- 🟡 **shipped, validation deferred** — code is in place but live test gated on operator prerequisites (e.g. Azure subscription)
- 🔵 **sibling-plugin lane** — better covered by Hermes' classic Teams adapter; cross-link rather than duplicate
- 🔴 **out of scope** — would need a separate package (declarative agents, Office Add-ins, etc.)
- ⚪ **non-surface** — not a chat/invoke endpoint (content layer, tooling concern)

| Surface | Best Hermes-stack path | Hermes-A365 coverage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Teams 1:1 chat (M365 agentic identity) | **Hermes-A365 Path A** | ✅ | Round-5 §9d validated 2026-05-06; round-8 E2E re-validated 2026-05-11 with streaming. Agent appears in "Built for your org" picker. |
| Teams 1:1 chat (generic chat bot, no M365 directory identity) | **Sibling Teams adapter** ([`plugins/platforms/teams/`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/tree/main/plugins/platforms/teams)) | 🔵 | Use the sibling for classic Teams 1:1 if you don't need M365-native agentic identity. |
| Teams group chat (`conversationType=groupChat`) | **Sibling Teams adapter** | 🔵 | Classic BF handles this natively. Hermes-A365 Path A doesn't reach group chats (agentic users are 1:1-only); Path B reaches it as a side effect of the Microsoft Teams channel, but the sibling is the cleaner tool. |
| Teams team channels (incl. `replyToId` threading) | **Sibling Teams adapter** | 🔵 | Same reasoning as group chat. |
| Teams meetings (in-call agent, `participantsAdded` / `meetingStart`) | **Sibling Teams adapter** | 🔵 | BF meeting events; sibling adapter's lane. |
| Mobile Teams | **Sibling Teams adapter** or Hermes-A365 Path A (1:1) | 🔵 / ✅ | Identical wire shape; either path's surfacing applies. |
| **M365 Copilot Chat** (standalone web app) | **Hermes-A365 Path B** | 🟡 | Custom Engine Agent emitter shipped 2026-05-12 (slice 19u-a, `hermes a365 publish --copilot-chat`). **Surfacing gated on Azure subscription + Azure Bot Service registration of the blueprint Entra app (Microsoft Teams channel enabled).** Live walkthrough 2026-05-12 confirmed the prerequisite. #16 deferred pending Azure provisioning. |
| Word / Excel / PowerPoint Copilot **side-panels** (Hermes as Copilot agent) | **Hermes-A365 Path B** | 🟡 | Same Custom Engine Agent registration as Copilot Chat lights these up; same Azure prerequisite. Distinct from declarative Office Copilot agents (those are a different runtime — see "Out of scope" below). |
| Outlook — chat-style invocation (Copilot Chat side-panel inside Outlook) | **Hermes-A365 Path B** | 🟡 | Same Custom Engine Agent path. |
| Microsoft Search invocation (`search` invoke) | **Hermes-A365 Path B** + #18 | 🟡 | Custom Engine Agent + invoke handling. Routed via Bot Service Microsoft Teams channel; specific to Copilot fabric. |
| Outlook — compose-action panels (`task/fetch` / `task/submit`) | Sibling Teams adapter OR Hermes-A365 Path B | 🔵 / 🟡 | Depends on whether the operator wants the compose-action backed by classic BF (sibling) or by the Copilot-fabric Custom Engine Agent (Path B). Either way needs invoke handling (#18). |
| Teams compose extensions ("@Hermes search …", `composeExtension/*` invokes) | **Sibling Teams adapter** + #18-shape work | 🔵 | Classic BF surface; sibling's lane. Hermes-A365 doesn't add value over the sibling here. |
| Outlook — email-only flow (agent receives + sends real email) | **Sibling Teams adapter** (`emailoffice365` channel) or Graph email skill | 🔵 | Niche; sibling can take it via the BF email channel. Hermes-A365 has no specific advantage. |
| Web chat / Direct Line embed | Sibling adapter or separate skill | 🔵 | Bypasses M365 entirely; not Hermes-A365's lane. |
| SharePoint embedded chat (`SPEmbedded`) | Sibling adapter or separate skill | 🔵 | Same — Direct Line, no M365 directory presence. |
| Slack / Telegram / WhatsApp / Twilio / Line / Kik / GroupMe | Use the respective Hermes platform adapters | 🔵 | Each external messenger has its own first-class Hermes adapter; Hermes-A365 not the right path. |
| Cron / proactive sends (Path A surfaces) | **Hermes-A365** | ✅ | Shipped in v0.5.0 / v0.5.1 (slices 19x-a..e; #4 closed, #27 closed). `Agent365Adapter.send()` falls through to `_send_proactive` when this gateway lifetime hasn't captured an inbound for `chat_id`; POSTs to `<serviceUrl>/v3/conversations/<conv_id>/activities` (`sendToConversation` — no `replyToId`). Path B proactive (BF S2S outbound) gated on #16. Sibling Teams adapter handles its own proactive sends independently. |
| Word / Excel / PowerPoint Copilot side-panel as **declarative agent** | Separate skill (not this one) | 🔴 | Declarative agents are a different runtime — Microsoft hosts the orchestrator + LLM. Hermes' value prop is the orchestrator, so we're a custom-engine agent (see Path B), not a declarative one. |
| Office Add-ins (ribbon button, task pane) | Separate skill | 🔴 | Different SDK entirely; would be a complementary `office-addin-*` package. |
| Loop components | Separate skill | 🔴 | Loop SDK; not a BF-protocol surface. |
| OneNote agent | Separate skill | 🔴 | Declarative-agent shape; not a custom-engine route. |
| SharePoint Embedded containers (file storage) | Graph tool integration | ⚪ | Content layer, not a surface. |
| Direct Line Speech | Separate skill if voice becomes a priority | 🔴 | Voice surface; needs STT/TTS pipeline Hermes doesn't have today. |
| Power Platform / Copilot Studio publish | Copilot Studio's own publish flow | ⚪ | Microsoft publishes the agent through Copilot Studio; not Hermes-A365's lane. |

## Surface vs publish flow (2026-05-11)

Two parallel publish flows from the same blueprint Entra app +
service principal. The runtime (Hermes plugin + activity bridge +
streaming) is identical for both; only the registration manifest
+ admin-centre flow differ.

| Flow | Wrapper command | Manifest type | `manifestVersion` | Admin upload | Surfaces it lights up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AI Teammate** | `hermes a365 publish --aiteammate --apply` | `agenticUserTemplates` shape | `devPreview` | M365 Admin Centre → Agents → Upload custom agent → Agent 365 admin centre per-user activation | Teams 1:1 ("Built for your org" list); shows up under the user's agentic identity |
| **Custom Engine Agent** | `hermes a365 publish --copilot-chat --apply` (add `--manifest-id auto` or a GUID when publishing beside AI Teammate) | `bots` + `copilotAgents.customEngineAgents` blocks | `1.21+` | Microsoft Admin Portal → Agents → Upload custom agent | M365 Copilot Chat (standalone web + side-panels in Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Outlook), Teams as a classic bot. **Hard prerequisite:** Azure subscription + Azure Bot Service registration (Microsoft Teams channel enabled) using the blueprint Entra app id. Without Bot Service registration, the agent enters the catalog but doesn't route in Copilot Chat — surfaced during the 2026-05-12 live walkthrough on the satscryption tenant which has no Azure subscription. AI Teammate path bypasses this because M365's agentic user infrastructure routes Teams 1:1 traffic without Azure Bot Service. |

Reasoning for keeping both: AI Teammates surface as agentic users
(distinct identity in the user's tenant directory) which is the
right shape for "Hermes is its own thing in your inbox"; Custom
Engine Agents surface as Copilot agents (`@`-mention in the
Copilot Chat prompt box) which is the right shape for "Hermes is
a Copilot specialist". Operators may want both for the same
underlying blueprint.

Per Microsoft's [Custom Engine Agents overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/extensibility/overview-custom-engine-agent#design-and-deployment-considerations):

> Custom engine agents are supported in app manifest version 1.21
> and later versions.

— meaning the `devPreview` AI Teammate manifest is structurally
incompatible with Copilot Chat surfacing. Emitter shipped 2026-05-12
in slice 19u-a (`hermes a365 publish --copilot-chat`). Live
walkthrough 2026-05-12 surfaced an additional hard prerequisite:
the Custom Engine Agent route requires an **Azure subscription** so
the blueprint Entra app can be registered as an Azure Bot Service
resource with the Microsoft Teams channel enabled. Without that,
the manifest uploads and lands in the Teams App Catalog but
Microsoft's routing layer doesn't forward Copilot Chat activities
to our `/api/messages` endpoint. The AI Teammate path bypasses this
because M365's agentic user infrastructure handles Teams 1:1
routing without Azure Bot Service. #16 deferred pending Azure
subscription decision.

## Surfaces we explicitly do NOT cover

Out-of-scope decisions, with reasons:

- **Generic Teams chat as a bot (1:1, group, channel, threading,
  attachments)** — sibling-plugin lane. Use Hermes' classic
  Bot-Framework Teams adapter (`plugins/platforms/teams/`,
  shipped v2026.4.30). Hermes-A365 adds nothing over the sibling
  for these surfaces unless the operator wants M365-native
  agentic-user identity (Path A) or Copilot-fabric surfacing
  (Path B).
- **Declarative agents** (Word / Excel / PowerPoint / OneNote
  native Copilot agents) — wrong runtime layer. Microsoft's
  orchestrator + foundation model handle the reasoning; we'd
  contribute *knowledge* and *actions*, not the agent loop.
  Hermes' value prop is the loop, so Hermes-A365 only does
  custom-engine agents.
- **Office Add-ins** — different SDK, different security model.
  Would be a separate *complementary* package
  (`office-addin-*`).
- **Loop components** — same shape as Office Add-ins.
- **Cortana / Direct Line Speech** — voice surface. Architecturally
  fine but no audio handling in Hermes today; non-priority.
- **Web chat / Direct Line / SharePoint Embedded** — bypass M365
  entirely. If you genuinely want web-chat reach, use a generic
  Direct Line skill rather than Hermes-A365.

## Validation status

| Surface | Walkthrough | Last validated | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Path A Teams 1:1 (round-5 §9d) | round-5 §9d | 2026-05-06 | ✅ E2E via Hermes plugin path |
| Path A Teams 1:1 (gateway-restart durability) | round-5 §9d.6 | 2026-05-06 | ✅ slice 19o registry hydrated |
| Path A Teams 1:1 (full E2E + streaming on v0.3.0) | round-8 | 2026-05-11 | ✅ BF streaming protocol via `edit_message` validated (closes #3) |
| Path A Teams 1:1 (proactive sendToConversation, v0.5.0 wire) | proactive soak | 2026-05-13 | ✅ token mint + `sendToConversation` POST + 201 wire-validated against live tenant; surfaced gate bug closed in v0.5.1 (#27) |
| Path B Copilot Chat (emitter only — no Azure sub) | 2026-05-12 | 2026-05-12 | 🟡 manifest emitter shipped; agent enters Teams App Catalog but doesn't surface in Copilot Chat without Azure Bot Service. #16 deferred. |
| All other surfaces | — | — | NOT YET WALKED (most are sibling-plugin lane) |

## Highest-value next walkthroughs

Ranked by "what would tell us most about Hermes-A365's lane for least effort":

1. **Path B Copilot Chat end-to-end** (#16) — gated on Azure
   subscription provisioning + Bot Service registration. Once
   that's in place, validates: Custom Engine Agent surfacing in
   Copilot Chat agents picker, streaming round-trip on a non-Teams
   surface, and the side-panel reach (Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Outlook)
   as a side effect. **Highest unique value** — the entire defensible
   reason to use Hermes-A365 over the sibling Teams adapter for
   anything beyond agentic-user identity.
2. **Path A AI Teammate on a fresh tenant** — re-walk the
   register → publish → instance → Teams 1:1 round-trip against
   the latest CLI on a clean tenant to catch wizard / setup
   regressions. Cheap; runs in the existing playbook
   (`references/live-tenant-test.md`).
3. **Outlook compose-action** (`task/fetch` / `task/submit`) via
   Path B — first invoke-type test; gated on #18 (invoke handlers).
   Depends on Path B Azure being live too.
4. **Microsoft Search invocation** via Path B — similar shape to
   compose-action; also needs #18 + Azure.

Sibling-plugin lane walks (Teams group / channel / meetings) are
**deliberately omitted** — they belong on the sibling adapter's
roadmap, not Hermes-A365's.

## Backlog impact

Existing open issues whose scope is touched by this matrix, with
their state under the reframed positioning:

- **#3 (streaming)** — **closed 2026-05-11** by slices 19s + 19s-bis.
  Custom-engine streaming protocol via `edit_message`. Applies to
  both Path A and Path B.
- **#4 (proactive)** — **closed 2026-05-13** by slices 19x-a..d in
  v0.5.0; v0.5.1 (#27, slice 19x-e) fixed the production gate.
  Path A proactive ships; Path B proactive gated on #16.
- **#27 (proactive gate)** — **closed 2026-05-13** by slice 19x-e
  in v0.5.1. Per-lifetime `_seen_inbounds_this_lifetime` set drives
  `send()`'s decision between `replyToActivity` and
  `sendToConversation`.
- **#13 (setup wizard)** — **closed 2026-05-11** by slice 19r.
  Interactive setup + drift detection ship in v0.2.0.
- **#14 (secret regression)** — closed 2026-05-07 by slice
  `--auto-recover-secret`.
- **#16 (Copilot Chat walkthrough)** — Path B's primary validation.
  Deferred pending Azure subscription decision.
- **#17 (Teams group + channel walkthrough)** — **superseded by
  the sibling Teams adapter's roadmap**. Hermes-A365 does not own
  this lane. Recommend closing in favour of cross-link to the
  sibling.
- **#18 (invoke activities)** — scope narrowed to Path B-relevant
  invokes: `task/fetch` / `task/submit` for Outlook compose-action
  inside Copilot, `search` for Microsoft Search inside Copilot,
  `signin/verifyState` for OAuth tools. Compose-extension invokes
  (`composeExtension/*`) move to the sibling adapter's roadmap.
- **#24 (Custom Engine Agent emitter)** — **closed 2026-05-12** by
  slice 19u-a.
- **#25 (setup wizard XDG symlink gap)** — **closed 2026-05-12**
  in v0.4.0 (slice 19r-bis).
- **#26 (`--manifest-id` flag)** — Path B-specific; v0.7.2 work
  adds `--manifest-id auto|<guid>` so operators can run A + B
  simultaneously with distinct Teams App Catalog ids while keeping
  `bots[0].botId` on the Bot Framework app id. The same slice also
  hardens emitted zip path parsing for workspaces containing spaces
  and keeps the CEA bot scope/command shape aligned with the
  2026-05-18 live walk.
