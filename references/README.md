# `references/`

Reference material for the `hermes-a365` skill. Most files here are
**dated snapshots** of an external surface (Microsoft Agent 365 CLI,
Entra error codes, blueprint properties, OpenTelemetry vocabulary, Bot
Framework activity shapes, license catalog) — *not* a source of truth.
`live-tenant-test.md` is the operator runbook for end-to-end validation.

The doctor (`scripts/doctor.py`) and individual subcommands cross-check
the live surface against these snapshots and warn on drift. When drift
is detected, the live surface is authoritative; update the corresponding
file here and bump the snapshot date.

Snapshot date convention: every snapshot file carries a top-level
`Snapshot date: YYYY-MM-DD` line. The skill's release notes call out
which references files were refreshed.
