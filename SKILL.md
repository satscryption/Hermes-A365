# Hermes A365

## Overview

Microsoft Agent 365 (A365, GA 2026-05-01) is a governance / identity /
observability control plane for AI agents that bolts on top of any agent
stack and adds Entra-backed identity, tenant licensing, agent blueprints,
MCP-mediated Microsoft 365 data access ("Work IQ"), Bot Framework activity
bridging, OpenTelemetry, and channel adapters for Teams / Outlook /
Microsoft 365 Copilot. This skill drives those capabilities from inside
the Hermes harness so a Hermes agent can appear as a first-class A365
agent without re-implementing any of the governance surface.

The wrapper is built directly on the GA `Microsoft.Agents.A365.DevTools.Cli`
verbs documented in [`references/a365-cli-reference.md`](references/a365-cli-reference.md).
The skill composes them into idempotent plan/apply flows, fills the
gaps the CLI doesn't cover (license decision, admin consent grant,
runtime `.env` generation), and ships a Bot Framework activity bridge
+ Hermes gateway platform plugin (`agent365`) that round-trips messages
between A365 and the Hermes agent loop.

## When to Use

Use when the user wants to:

- Stand up a brand-new A365-governed Hermes agent on a clean Microsoft
  tenant.
- Package an existing Hermes agent's manifest for upload to the M365
  Admin Centre (channel deployment is operator-side).
- Verify environment / config / scope posture before or after a change.
- Tear down an agent's Azure App Service, instance identity, and
  blueprint app cleanly.
- Migrate an OpenClaw-on-A365 deployment to Hermes (the existing
  blueprint stays; only the runtime endpoint changes).

Don't use when:

- Generic Microsoft Graph access is the goal — use a Graph-only skill.
- Deploying a Bot Framework bot **outside** A365 governance.
- Setting up OpenAI Agents SDK or another framework end-to-end — A365
  governs the runtime; pick the appropriate framework skill for the
  agent itself.

## Prerequisites

- A Microsoft 365 tenant where the operator has **Global Administrator**
  or **Agent Administrator** role and is enrolled in Microsoft's
  Frontier Preview Program.
- The A365 CLI on PATH: `Microsoft.Agents.A365.DevTools.Cli` (.NET tool,
  ships as `a365`), ≥ 1.1.171. Only the .NET tool ships at GA — the
  npm `atk` variant referenced in pre-GA documentation never landed.
- `az` CLI ≥ 2.55.0, signed into the target tenant. Many `a365`
  subcommands shell out to `az` for Entra reads.
- **PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`) on PATH.** The CLI invokes `pwsh` for some
  setup steps; missing `pwsh` causes `a365 setup requirements` to fail.
- A custom Entra client app (Microsoft's convention: display name
  `Agent 365 CLI`) registered in the tenant. The CLI uses it as the
  device-code/auth-code client. Doctor verifies discoverability via the
  signed-in `az` context.
- An OS keychain: macOS Security or Linux libsecret (`secret-tool`).
  Windows is not yet supported.
- A tenant license: either the **Agent 365 add-on** ($15/user/month) or
  **Microsoft 365 E7** ($99/user/month). The skill never purchases — it
  recommends; see [`references/license-cost-table.md`](references/license-cost-table.md).
- A Hermes harness with `hermes-a365` installed into its venv
  (`~/.hermes/hermes-agent/venv/bin/pip install 'hermes-a365[bridge]'`)
  so the plugin loader auto-discovers `agent365` via the
  `hermes_agent.plugins` entry point, plus `plugins.enabled` and a
  `gateway.platforms.agent365` block configured in
  `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. The README quickstart walks through this
  end-to-end.

## Core procedures

State-mutating subcommands default to **dry-run**; pass `--apply` to
execute. Repeated invocation converges to the same state.

### `hermes a365 doctor`

Read-only environment probe. Exit 0/1/2. Probes: `a365`, `az` (signed
in), `pwsh`, the `Agent 365 CLI` Entra app, network reachability
(login.microsoftonline.com / graph.microsoft.com), keychain,
`~/.hermes/.env`, Hermes harness. Frontier Preview enrollment is not
auto-verifiable.

### `hermes a365 license --users <n> --agents <n> --plan <E3|E5|...>`

Read-only. Recommends the A365 add-on or E7 based on the decision matrix
in [`references/license-cost-table.md`](references/license-cost-table.md).
Records the chosen model in `~/.hermes/.env` as `A365_LICENSE_MODEL`.

### `hermes a365 register --agent-name <name> [--tenant-id <id>] [--m365] [--aiteammate] [--no-endpoint] [--skip-requirements]`

Composite plan that orchestrates the three real CLI steps a blueprint
needs:

1. `a365 setup blueprint --agent-name <name>` — registers the Entra app
   and service principal that back the blueprint.
2. `a365 setup permissions mcp --agent-name <name>` — configures MCP
   OAuth grants and inheritable permissions.
3. `a365 setup permissions bot --agent-name <name>` — configures the
   Messaging Bot API OAuth grants.

The CLI itself owns idempotency, JSON shape, and Entra round-trips. The
skill's job is to compose the right argv per step, run them in order via
the `Mutator` protocol, persist derived display names to
`a365.config.json` (so subsequent commands refer to consistent
identities), and surface known auth errors:

- `AADSTS500011` (license not propagated): retried up to `--retries`
  times with `--backoff` seconds (defaults: 3 × 30 s, mockable in tests
  via `sleep_fn`).
- `AADSTS90094` (admin consent required): surfaced as
  "deferred — run `hermes a365 consent`" rather than failing the run.
  The blueprint apps remain created.

`--m365` registers the messaging endpoint via MCP Platform.
`--aiteammate` treats the agent as an AI Teammate (creates an Entra
user + manager). `--no-endpoint` and `--skip-requirements` are
passthroughs to `a365 setup blueprint`.

### `hermes a365 consent`

Renders the admin-consent URL from `templates/consent-url.txt.j2`, opens
it in the default browser (unless `--no-open`), then polls
`a365 query-entra blueprint-scopes` every 5 s up to a 5 min timeout.
Idempotent; re-running after grant is a no-op.

### `hermes a365 instance create <slug> --owner <email> --owner-aad-id <oid> [...]`

Pure local config-file writer. The server-side agent identity is created
by `a365 setup blueprint` (driven by `register`); this command only
produces the per-agent `~/.hermes/agents/<slug>/.env` that runtime
consumers read for slug, owner, OTLP endpoint, and business-hours
metadata.

Inherits `A365_APP_ID`, `A365_TENANT_ID`, `HERMES_OTLP_ENDPOINT` from
`~/.hermes/.env`. An existing `AA_INSTANCE_ID` is preserved across
re-runs; business-hours fields from a prior run are also preserved
unless explicitly overridden. The per-agent .env never contains the
blueprint client secret — see pitfall #7 below for where the secret
actually lives.

### `hermes a365 publish --agent-name <name> [--aiteammate] [--use-blueprint] [--tenant-id <id>]`

Wraps `a365 publish` to package the agent manifest into the zip the
operator uploads to the M365 Admin Centre. Channel deployment is
**operator-side**: the admin signs in to the centre, uploads the
zip, and approves the agent for users in the desired DLP scope. The
wrapper surfaces the resulting package path plus an admin-centre URL
hint.

### `hermes a365 status [<slug>]`

Per-component report against the verified `query-entra` surface. Four
components only:

- `local_config`     — parent `~/.hermes/.env` (and per-agent .env if a
  slug is given) parseable + required keys present.
- `blueprint_scopes` — `a365 query-entra blueprint-scopes` for the
  agent's blueprint.
- `instance_scopes`  — `a365 query-entra instance-scopes` for the
  agent's instance.
- `activity_bridge`  — local PID-file probe (only when a slug is given
  AND `bridge.pid` exists). When the bridge is running this row reports
  `ok`; absent pidfile is `missing` (bridge not currently running) and
  a stale or unreadable pidfile is `error`.

Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` partial, `2` broken, `3` skill not yet bootstrapped.

### `hermes a365 cleanup --agent-name <name> [--kinds=...] --confirm=<name> --apply`

Destructive teardown. Drives `a365 cleanup azure` → `instance` →
`blueprint` (safe → unsafe — App Service first so the runtime stops
before the Entra identity is revoked). Local artefacts under
`~/.hermes/agents/<slug>/` are removed after all cloud steps succeed.
`--kinds=<subset>` runs only the requested kinds. `--confirm` must
equal `--agent-name`. The plan is always printed for operator
audit before any mutation.

### `hermes a365 activity-bridge`

The Bot Framework adapter daemon. Two main modes are available either
as a standalone process (operator launches it) or as the runtime that
backs the `agent365` Hermes gateway platform plugin (the gateway
loads it in-process when an agent has the `agent365` platform enabled).

- `verify --slug <slug>` — one-shot diagnostic (config + auth +
  reachability). Exit 0/1/2.
- `serve --slug <slug> --port 3978` — BF webhook adapter daemon.
  Validates inbound activities as **AAD-v2** (A365 / MCP Platform
  issues AAD-v2 tokens directly to bot endpoints, not classic BF
  tokens), dedupes BF retries, gates `serviceUrl` against the
  Microsoft host suffix, and replies through the **agentic three-stage
  user-FIC token chain** (BF S2S → agent FMI → user FIC). Outbound
  goes via `replyToActivity` against the cached inbound `serviceUrl`.
- `update-endpoint --agent-name <n> --url <https>` — wraps
  `a365 setup blueprint --m365 --update-endpoint <url>` so operators
  can pin the agent's messaging endpoint to a tunnel URL. Auto-recovers
  from [duplicate-name error #140](https://github.com/microsoft/Agent365-devTools/issues/140).

Topology: Teams (or other M365 surface) → A365 BF → `<tunnel>/api/messages`
→ bridge → Hermes agent loop → reply via `serviceUrl`. Activity-shape
catalogue: [`references/activity-protocol-shapes.md`](references/activity-protocol-shapes.md);
operator-side network exposure options:
[`references/exposing-the-bot-endpoint.md`](references/exposing-the-bot-endpoint.md).

**Surfaces that work today:** Teams 1:1 chat (validated end-to-end
across rounds 3–5). Teams group / channel paths are architecturally
covered (`_activity_to_event` maps `chat_type`) but unwalked. M365
Copilot Chat needs streaming (#3) and proactive replies (#4) before
it ships; Outlook compose-action needs invoke handling (#18). See
[`references/m365-surface-coverage.md`](references/m365-surface-coverage.md)
for the per-surface matrix.

## Conflict resolution

| Conflict | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Blueprint app already exists for the same name | `a365 setup blueprint` is itself idempotent; `register` re-runs are safe. |
| Permissions step fails with `AADSTS90094` | Reported as "deferred — run `hermes a365 consent`"; blueprint stays created. |
| Instance .env exists with a previous `AA_INSTANCE_ID` | `instance create` preserves the id (cloud state is unchanged). |
| Cleanup target has no recorded state | The corresponding kind is skipped, not errored. |
| License missing or insufficient | `register` retries `AADSTS500011` with backoff; on exhaustion the operator runs `hermes a365 license` and re-tries. |
| `pwsh` missing on PATH | Doctor flags it; `a365 setup` itself fails fast with a CLI error referencing `setup requirements`. |

## Common pitfalls

1. **Channel deployment is operator-side.** There is no `deploy` verb.
   `publish` produces the zip; the M365 admin uploads and approves it.
2. **Delegated permissions, not application permissions.** A365
   explicitly requires delegated permissions. Pasting an application-
   permission consent URL silently breaks at runtime.
3. **One agent name, derived sub-names.** `--agent-name "Inbox Helper"`
   produces `Inbox Helper Identity` and `Inbox Helper Blueprint` inside
   the CLI. Don't pass those derived names directly — pass the base.
4. **Blueprint slug ≠ agent name.** `register` operates on the CLI
   `--agent-name`. The local `<slug>` used in `instance create` /
   `status` / `cleanup` is the per-agent dir name under
   `~/.hermes/agents/`. Keep them aligned (lowercased / hyphenated) by
   convention; the skill never silently re-derives one from the other.
5. **License propagation lag.** A365 license assignment can lag 5–30
   min after purchase. `register` retries `AADSTS500011` 3× with 30 s
   backoff; if you're outside that window, `hermes a365 doctor` is the
   first port of call.
6. **`AA_INSTANCE_ID` reuse across re-runs.** `instance create`
   preserves the existing id. Don't manually edit the per-agent .env to
   "reset" it without first running `cleanup` — the cloud instance will
   linger.
7. **Blueprint client secret on disk in plaintext (macOS / Linux).**
   `a365 setup blueprint` writes the secret to
   `a365.generated.config.json` — DPAPI-encrypted on Windows,
   plaintext elsewhere. That file and the `cleanup -y`-emitted
   `*.backup-*.json` are gitignored; treat both as keychain-grade.

## Verification checklist

- [ ] `hermes a365 doctor` exits 0.
- [ ] `hermes a365 status <slug>` shows: local_config ok,
      blueprint_scopes ok, instance_scopes ok.
- [ ] `a365 publish` zip uploaded via the M365 Admin Centre and
      approved for the target DLP scope.
- [ ] Test message in Teams (or other approved channel) returns an
      Adaptive Card from the agent.
- [ ] OTLP trace visible in the A365 admin centre for the test message.
- [ ] `hermes a365 cleanup --agent-name <name>` (dry-run) lists exactly
      the resources the operator expects to remove.

## One-shot recipes

### Bootstrap a single agent on a clean tenant

```
hermes a365 doctor                                                     # health check
hermes a365 license --users <n> --agents <n> --plan E5                 # decide license
hermes a365 register --agent-name "<Display Name>"                     # plan
hermes a365 register --agent-name "<Display Name>" --apply --auto-recover-secret
hermes a365 consent                                                    # in-browser grant
hermes a365 instance create <slug> --owner <email> --owner-aad-id <oid> --apply
hermes a365 publish --agent-name "<Display Name>" --aiteammate --apply # produce zip
# Operator: upload the zip in the M365 Admin Centre and approve for users.
hermes a365 activity-bridge verify --slug <slug>                       # bridge preflight
# Run the gateway with the agent365 platform configured (loads the
# bridge in-process via the entry-point-discovered plugin):
hermes gateway run --profile <slug>
hermes a365 status <slug>                                              # final verification
```

### Re-target an existing OpenClaw-on-A365 agent at Hermes

The blueprint stays in place; only the runtime endpoint and per-agent
config change:

```
hermes a365 instance create <slug> --owner <email> --owner-aad-id <oid> --apply
hermes a365 publish --agent-name "<Existing Display Name>" --apply
# Operator re-uploads the zip; the activity bridge then takes over the
# BF subscription URL the previous runtime was using.
```

### Decommission an agent cleanly

```
hermes a365 cleanup --agent-name "<Display Name>"                              # plan
hermes a365 cleanup --agent-name "<Display Name>" --apply --confirm="<Display Name>"
```

`--kinds=instance,blueprint` skips Azure when the App Service was
provisioned out-of-band. Tenant-wide infrastructure (Frontier Preview
enrollment, the custom `Agent 365 CLI` client app, license) is never
touched.

Subcommand implementations live under `src/hermes_a365/`; each is a
thin CLI over a planner + applier pair parameterised by a `Mutator`
protocol so the apply path is unit-testable without the live A365 CLI.

`hermes_a365._data.templates`; dated reference snapshots live under
